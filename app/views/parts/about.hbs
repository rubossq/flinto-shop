    <h3>OUR STORY</h3>


    One of the most iconic fashion brands in Australia, many have grown up with the family owned “Betts & Betts” stores,
    a name synonymous with shoes. Founded in 1892, the first store was opened on Hay Street in Perth City in 1912 and
    became the biggest shoe store in the country, taking Perth by storm. Throughout the 1940’s and 50’s, it continued to
    be the biggest store in Australia and following a major refit in 1951, it became the biggest shoe store in the
    Southern Hemisphere. Major expansion took place in the 70’s and 80’s where the business expanded nationally. Now the
    Betts brand has 90 locations Australia-wide. With the original family values still at the heart of the business,
    Betts continues to run as a family business, bringing the Betts legacy into the fifth generation.
