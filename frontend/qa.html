                <p>Amazon.com knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your
                    trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By
                    visiting Amazon.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>


                <h3>What Personal Information About Customers Does Amazon.com Gather?</h3>
                <p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your Amazon
                    experience. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>

                <p>Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in
                    any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain
                    information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the
                    information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future
                    shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you.
                    Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with
                    us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information
                    when your Web browser accesses Amazon.com or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf
                    of Amazon.com on other Web sites. Click here to see examples of the information we receive.
                    Mobile: When you download or use apps created by Amazon or our subsidiaries, we may receive
                    information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your
                    device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as
                    advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn
                    off location services. For more information about how to do this,click here .
                    E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a
                    confirmation when you open e-mail from Amazon.com if your computer supports such capabilities.
                    We</p>

                <h3>What About Cookies?</h3>
                <p>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize
                    your device and to provide features such as 1-Click purchasing, Recommended for You , personalized
                    advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., Amazon Associates with content served by Amazon.com and Web
                    sites using Checkout by Amazon payment service), and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between
                    visits.
                    The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
                    cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
                    altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as
                    Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.
                    Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Amazon.com's essential features, we recommend
                    that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will
                    not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any Amazon.com products
                    and services that require you to Sign in.
                    Does Amazon.com Share the Information It Receives?
                    Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business
                    of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries
                    Amazon.com, Inc. controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at
                    least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases,
                    such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.com or sell offerings to you
                    at Amazon.com. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly
                    with these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell
                    when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to
                    those transactions with that third party.
                    Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
                    behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail,
                    removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
                    providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card
                    payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform
                    their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
                    Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Amazon.com customers on behalf of
                    other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not
                    want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences .
                    Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores,
                    subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the
                    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                    Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that
                    Amazon.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of
                    course be one of the transferred assets.
                    Protection of Amazon.com and Others: We release account and other personal information when we
                    believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and
                    other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon.com, our users, or others.
                    This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
                    credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or
                    otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in
                    violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
                    With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you
                    might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
                    How Secure Is Information About Me?
                    We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets
                    Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
                    We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course,
                    we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order
                    processing.
                    It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your
                    computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information
                    on how to sign off.</p>

                <h3>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h3>
                <p>Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other Web sites. For more information about
                    third-party advertising at Amazon.com, including personalized or interest-based ads, please read our
                    Interest-Based Ads policy.</p>

                <h3>Which Information Can I Access?</h3>
                <p>Amazon.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions
                    with Amazon.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.
                    Click here to see some examples, the list of which will change as our Web site evolves.

                <h3>What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
                <p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed
                    to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Amazon.com features as Your Profile, Wish Lists ,
                    Customer Reviews, and Amazon Prime.
                    You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the Which Information
                    Can I Access? section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for
                    our records.
                    If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer
                    Communication Preferences . (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices
                    from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Amazon.com, and it
                    is your responsibility to review them for changes.)
                    If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to
                    personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences .
                    The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
                    cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies
                    altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as
